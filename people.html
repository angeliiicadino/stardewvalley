							The Dwarf is a valley resident who lives in The Mines. Initially the way is blocked off by an unbreakable rock, just inside the entrance. After upgrading to at least a steel pickaxe, the stone can be broken. A cherry bomb (or stronger bomb) will also break the rock.<br><br>

							The Dwarf will start out speaking Dwarvish, which is unreadable by the player. To understand Dwarvish the 4 Dwarvish scrolls must be acquired from within the mines. After donating them to the museum, Gunther will reward the player with the Dwarvish Translation Guide to use which allows for understanding the Dwarf's speech. Purchases from the Dwarf's shop cannot be made and friendship cannot be affected with the Dwarf until Dwarvish is understood. <br><br>
