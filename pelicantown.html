							  						  <b>Pelican Town is where the player moves to at the start of the game, located in Stardew Valley. It is where most of the villagers live, work, and socialize. The northwest entrance to town connects to the Bus Stop and The Farm. The southwest passage connects to Cindersap Forest, which contains Marnie's Ranch, Leah's Cottage, and the Wizard's Tower. Directly south of town is The Beach. North of town connects to The Mountain, with Robin's carpenter shop, the mines, the Adventurer's Guild, the Railroad, and the Quarry.</b><br>

                					<p> Some products in stock, namely seeds, will vary from season to season and others are in-stock year-round. Pierre's main competitor in the valley is JojaMart.</p>
                					<p> Pierre's General Store is normally open most days at 9am, three hours after the player wakes up, and closes at 5pm.  </p>
